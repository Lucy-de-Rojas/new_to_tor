        <img src="./Media/HddienWikiHomePage.jpg">




<p>
    The Hidden Wiki is a directory of websites that exist on the dark web, typically accessible via the Tor network (a privacy-focused browser that allows anonymous access to `.onion` sites). The Hidden Wiki acts like a "starting point" for users who are exploring the dark web, as it lists and categorizes a variety of `.onion` links.
</p>

        <h2> These links often include:</h2>


        <ul>
                <li>Forums and chat rooms</li>
                <li>Whistleblower platforms (e.g., SecureDrop)</li>
                <li>Marketplaces (some legal, some not)</li>
                <li>Privacy-focused services</li>
                <li>Hacking or security resources</li>
                <li>Cryptocurrency tools</li>
        </ul>





<h2>Important Caveats:</h2>


<ul>
        <li><strong>Not all content is legal or safe:</strong> The Hidden Wiki may link to sites involving illegal activities (e.g., drug markets, counterfeit goods, exploitative content). Extreme caution is advised.</li>
        <li><strong>Anonymity â‰  safety:</strong> While Tor offers privacy, it doesn't make you invulnerable. Many dark web scams, malware, and honeypots exist.</li>
        <li><strong>There are multiple versions:</strong> Some versions of the Hidden Wiki are legitimate, while others are altered or malicious.</li>
</ul>




<h2>If you're exploring for research or curiosity, it's best to:</h2>
<ul>
        <li>Use a secure, up-to-date Tor browser</li>
        <li>Avoid clicking on suspicious or unverified links</li>
        <li>Never download files or provide personal information</li>
</ul>
